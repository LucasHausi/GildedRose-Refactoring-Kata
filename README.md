## Test-strategy
We decieded to read the GildedRoseRequirements.md first and write tests for the requirements in a TDD-Style.
Also Parameterized-Tests were used to test multiple values in one test.

## Commit Message Policy
To commit consistent meaningful messages we decided on this  template:

Summary: Short summary of the changes
Description: More detailed description of the added functionality e.g. Tests.
For example - This commit includes tests for the behaviour....

## Comment strategy
We tried to follow the scout rule. When encountering we did describe some functionality as a comment if it provides benefits for others.

## Challenges
We did not encounter major challenges although the main GildedRose update logic is at first a bit complex and hard to understand.
